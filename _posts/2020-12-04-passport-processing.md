## Part 1

This post explores day 4 of Advent of Code 2020! You can find the description for part 1 of this exercise
[here](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/3).


### The goal

For this exercise, we need to determine which passports are valid. A passport can contain the following fields:

```text
byr (Birth Year)
iyr (Issue Year)
eyr (Expiration Year)
hgt (Height)
hcl (Hair Color)
ecl (Eye Color)
pid (Passport ID)
cid (Country ID)
```

For a passport to valid, it must contain all of these fields except the `cid` (Country ID) field, which is optional.


### Parsing the input

In most of the exercises we've seen so far, the input has been in a very structured, consistent format. However, in this
exercise, things can be a little different. Let's look at the example batch file.

```text
ecl:gry pid:860033327 eyr:2020 hcl:#fffffd
byr:1937 iyr:2017 cid:147 hgt:183cm

iyr:2013 ecl:amb cid:350 eyr:2023 pid:028048884
hcl:#cfa07d byr:1929

hcl:#ae17e1 iyr:2013
eyr:2024
ecl:brn pid:760753108 byr:1931
hgt:179cm

hcl:#cfa07d eyr:2025 pid:166559648
iyr:2011 ecl:brn hgt:59in
```

The passports are separated by blank lines, but each field can be separated by spaces _or_ newlines. This makes things a
little more tricky! Let's walk through a few possibilities and think if they would work. We can't just read each line
one at a time, because that would put different parts of the same passport in different sections. We could maybe go
through each line at a time and add it to a running total until we found a blank line, but that sounds a little tedious
and error-prone. Is there a better solution?

What if we read the entire batch file at once and then split on blank lines? Python strings have a `.split()` method
that can take a string (not just a single character), so we should be able to split on `\n\n` (two newlines in a
row). Let's try it!

For convenience, I'm going to save the example batch file in a file named `example.txt` so we can work with it. I hope
this will make it easier to follow along than if I used my personalized `input.txt` file.

```python
>>> text = open('example.txt').read()
>>> passports_texts = text.split('\n\n')
>>> passports_texts[0]
'ecl:gry pid:860033327 eyr:2020 hcl:#fffffd\nbyr:1937 iyr:2017 cid:147 hgt:183cm'
```

Looks good! Now we need to get one section for each `key:value` pair. The issue here is that we have two kinds of
[delimiters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter): spaces and newlines. The `.split()` method only accepts a single
delimiter, so we could either split on spaces or on newlines, but not both. Darn.

However, let's look a little closer at the `.split()` method. Python has a built-in help system, so let's use it.

```text
>>> help(str.split)
Help on method_descriptor:

split(self, /, sep=None, maxsplit=-1)
    Return a list of the words in the string, using sep as the delimiter string.

    sep
      The delimiter according which to split the string.
      None (the default value) means split according to any whitespace,
      and discard empty strings from the result.
    maxsplit
      Maximum number of splits to do.
      -1 (the default value) means no limit.
```

Well would you look at that. If we don't pass in a value for `sep` (the "separator" or delimiter), then it splits it
according to _any_ whitespace. That's exactly what we want!

```python
>>> passport = passports_texts[0].split()
>>> passport
['ecl:gry', 'pid:860033327', 'eyr:2020', 'hcl:#fffffd', 'byr:1937', 'iyr:2017', 'cid:147', 'hgt:183cm']
```

The last step is to break apart the `key` from the `value` in the `key:value` pairs. Looks like another job for
`.split()`! That method has definitely been useful today. This time we'll use `:` as the delimiter.

```python
>>> [pair.split(':') for pair in passport]
[['ecl', 'gry'], ['pid', '860033327'], ['eyr', '2020'], ['hcl', '#fffffd'], ['byr', '1937'], ['iyr', '2017'], ['cid', '147'], ['hgt', '183cm']]
```

That looks pretty good. My only complaint is that each `key`/`value` pair is in a list, not a tuple. That seem like a
minor nitpick, but lists and tuples imply different things and have different capabilities. A list can be any size and
can be dynamically resized. A tuple has a fixed size and cannot be resized. In this case, each `key`/`value` pair should
always have exactly two elements: the `key` and the `value`. It should never have three elements! Let's modify our code
slightly to use tuples instead.

```python
>>> [tuple(pair.split(':')) for pair in passport]
[('ecl', 'gry'), ('pid', '860033327'), ('eyr', '2020'), ('hcl', '#fffffd'), ('byr', '1937'), ('iyr', '2017'), ('cid', '147'), ('hgt', '183cm')]
```

Ah, much better! Much better for me, at least. Let's combine each part into a single function! Or actually several
functions.


```python
def parse_passports(text):
    passports_text = text.split('\n\n')
    return [parse_passport(pt) for pt in passports_text]

def parse_passport(passport_text):
    pairs = passport_text.split()
    return [tuple(pair.split(':')) for pair in pairs]
```

And a quick test to see if things worked.

```python
>>> text = open('example.txt').read()
>>> passports = parse_passports(text)
>>> passports[0]
[('ecl', 'gry'), ('pid', '860033327'), ('eyr', '2020'), ('hcl', '#fffffd'), ('byr', '1937'), ('iyr', '2017'), ('cid', '147'), ('hgt', '183cm')]
```

Looks great!


### Validate passports

Now we need to determine which passports are valid. To review:

> For a passport to valid, it must contain all of these fields except the `cid` (Country ID) field, which is optional.

We simply need to check and make sure that all required keys are present. That's actually not too bad! First, let's
create a list of all the required keys.

```python
required_keys = ['byr', 'iyr', 'eyr', 'hgt', 'hcl', 'ecl', 'pid', 'cid']
```

Oh, wait, the `cid` isn't required! Let's remove that.

```python
required_keys = ['byr', 'iyr', 'eyr', 'hgt', 'hcl', 'ecl', 'pid']
```

For each passport, what we would like to do is to iterate through the required keys and see if they are
present. However, there's not a super-simple (or super-efficient) way to do that if each passport is a list of
tuples. What if our passports were, instead, a dictionary/map?

A dictionary, or map, is a data structure that maps a collection of keys to their corresponding values. Huh, that's
exactly what each passport is. I guess we should have used a dictionary from the beginning.

Fortunately, in Python, it's pretty easy to convert a list of `key`/`value` pairs into a `dict`. Simply use the `dict`
function!

```python
>>> dict(passports[0])
{'ecl': 'gry', 'pid': '860033327', 'eyr': '2020', 'hcl': '#fffffd', 'byr': '1937', 'iyr': '2017', 'cid': '147', 'hgt':
'183cm'}
```

Well that was easy. Let's modify our original `parse_passport` function to return a `dict` instead.

```python
def parse_passport(passport_text):
    pairs = passport_text.split()
    return dict(pair.split(':') for pair in pairs)
```

The careful observer will note that I've removed the call to `tuple` and I'm using a list comprehension...without a
list? As it turns out, 1) the `dict` function can take a sequence of two-element lists, so we don't need to wrap it in a
tuple, and 2) Python has [generator
comprehensions](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Generators_and_Comprehensions.html#Creating-your-own-generator:-generator-comprehensions),
which remove the need to explicitly wrap it in a list (when I didn't need one anyways). Neither of these are important
details, though, so feel free to ignore them if you're confused.

Let's see how our new function works.

```python
>>> passports = parse_passports(text)
>>> passports[0]
{'ecl': 'gry', 'pid': '860033327', 'eyr': '2020', 'hcl': '#fffffd', 'byr': '1937', 'iyr': '2017', 'cid': '147', 'hgt': '183cm'}
```

Looks good! Now we're finally ready to write our `is_valid_passport` function. For that, we'll simply go through the
each required key and see if it's present in the passport.

```python
def is_valid_passport(required_keys, passport):
    for key in required_keys:
        if key not in passport:
            return False
    return True
```

If you're new to Python, the `not in` syntax may seem weird, but it does what you would expect: checks if a key is
present in a `dict`. If any of the keys are missing, we return `False` because the passport is missing a required
key. If we get to the end of the list of required keys and we haven't quit yet, then all of the required keys must have
been present. So we return `True`. Let's see if it works for each of our example passports.

```python
>>> for passport in passports:
...     print(is_valid_passport(required_keys, passport))
...
True
False
True
False
```

This matches what the explanation of the example saysâ€”the first and third are valid, the second and fourth are
invalid. Looks like we're set to go!


### Counting valid passports

Now we need to get all of our passports and count how many are valid. We'll use the same strategy we used in [day
2](../02/day-2-password-philosphy.html), namely list comprehension and `.count(True)`.

```python
def count_valid_passports(required_keys, passports):
    valids = [is_valid_passport(required_keys, p) for p in passports]
    return valids.count(True)
```

Let's try that for the example.

```python
>>> count_valid_passports(required_keys, passports)
2
```

Looks good! It looks like all of our pieces are coming together. Time to see if we can get the right answer for the
_real_ input.

```python
>>> text = open('input.txt').read()
>>> passports = parse_passports(text)
>>> count_valid_passports(required_keys, passports)
182
```

And submitted...and yes! That is the correct answer. Hooray!

Check back later for part 2!
