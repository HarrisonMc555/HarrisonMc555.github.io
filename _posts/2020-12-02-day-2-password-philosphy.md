## Part 1

This post explores day 2 of Advent of Code 2020! You can find the description for part 1 of this exercise
[here](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/2).


### The goal

For this exercise, we get a list of passwords and need to determine which ones are valid. However, instead of having the
same rules apply to all passwords, each password entry has additional information that determines what constitutes a
valid password.

Here is the example list of passwords:

```text
1-3 a: abcde
1-3 b: cdefg
2-9 c: ccccccccc
```

The numbers specify the minimum and maximum number of times the given letter can appear.


### Reading the input

First, let's start by reading the lines from the input file.

```python
def get_lines_from_file(filename):
    with open(filename) as f:
        return [line.strip() for line in f.readlines()]
```

Next, we need to parse each line. Each line has four different pieces of information that we care about:

  1. The minimum number
  2. The maximum number
  3. The letter
  4. The password

We could use Python's `.split()` method to split on spaces, hyphens, and colons. However, this is a perfect time to use
a [regular expression](https://www.regular-expressions.info/)! Regular expressions are perfect when the input is in
consistent, simple format.

Let's explore the format of each line a little closer.

```text
 +---------- hyphen
 |
 | +-------- space
 | |
 | | +------ colon
 | | |
 | | |   +-- * password
 | | |   |
 | | | /---\
1-3 a: abcde
| | | |
| | | +----- space
| | |
| | +------- * letter
| |
| +--------- * minimum number
|
+----------- * maximum number
```

Every part of the format is important when creating a regular expression, since a mismatch will prevent the pattern from
matching. Each section labeled with a `*` is a piece that we want to keep and remember. The other parts are just for
formatting and can be thrown away once we get the pieces we need.

We want to create a regular expression pattern that matches this pattern and remembers the parts we care about. The
pieces we care about need to be in groups (surrounded by parentheses) so we can extract them later. This is the pattern
I came up with. If you're unfamiliar with regular expressions don't worry too much about it. They are a good tool,
though, so I would recommend learning about them!

```text
(\d+)-(\d+) ([a-z]): ([a-z]+)
```

Fortunately for us, Python includes an implementation of regular expressions by default with the `re` module. We can
"compile" the regular expression into a pattern that we can use repeatedly like so:

```python
import re
pattern = re.compile('(\d+)-(\d+) ([a-z]): ([a-z]+)')
```

Let's test our pattern against one of the samples!

```python
>>> pattern.match('1-3 a: abcde')
<re.Match object; span=(0, 12), match='1-3 a: abcde'>
```

It looks like it worked! If it didn't match, then it would have returned `None` (`null`). The return value looks a
little weird when we print it out, but that's okâ€”what we really want is the groups of the pattern. We can extract each
group with the `.group()` method or get all of them with `.groups()`. Let's get all of them and take a look.

```python
>>> match = pattern.match('1-3 a: abcde')
>>> match.groups()
('1', '3', 'a', 'abcde')
```

Perfect! This has extracted each element we care about into separate elements of a tuple. The only thing we're missing
now is that each element is still a string (`str`), but we want the first two elements to be numbers (`int`s). Let's
unpack the tuple, parse the strings into numbers, and re-pack it into a tuple again.

> This could be a situation where we could use a class with named fields. However, since this is just a simple exercise
> (and the tuple will only be just a few times) we'll just stick with an unnamed tuple.

```python
>>> count_min, count_max, letter, password = match.groups()
>>> int(count_min), int(count_max), letter, password
(1, 3, 'a', 'abcde')
```

You may look at the output here and say that we didn't change anything. However, if you look closely, the first two
elements in the tuple are no longer surrounded by single quotes (`'`). In the first example, they were strings
(`str`s). In this example, they are `int`s. Keeping track of data types is very important when programming. Let's
combine all of these pieces into a single `parse_line` function.

```python
LINE_RE = re.compile('(\d+)-(\d+) ([a-z]): ([a-z]+)')
def parse_line(line):
    count_min, count_max, letter, password = LINE_RE.match(line).groups()
    return int(count_min), int(count_max), letter, password
```

You may have noticed that I put the pattern into global `LINE_RE` variable. Compiling a regular expression is a
non-trivial operation, and you should always try to avoid doing that in a loop whenever possible. Since I need the same
regular expression pattern for every line, it's better to compile it once and use it many times.

Now that we can parse each line into a tuple with the information we need, we need to determine if the password is valid
or not. Let's review the rules for valid passwords.

> The password policy indicates the lowest and highest number of times a given letter must appear for the password to be
> valid.

Our first goal is to determine how many times the given letter appears in the password. Fortunately for us, Python
includes a `.count()` method on strings. In our example password, the given letter was `a` and the password was
`'abcde'`. This password contains one `a`, so the return value should be `1`.

```python
>>> 'abcde'.count('a')
1
```

Great! Now we need to check that it is between the minimum and maximum numbers. This is actually a great opportunity to
take advantage of Python's [chained comparisons](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#comparisons). We
want to make sure that the minimum value is less than or equal to the count, which is less than or equal to the maximum
value. Here's what that looks like in Python.

```python
>>> occurrences = 'abcde'.count('a')
>>> 1 <= occurrences <= 3
True
```

With that, we have what we need to write an `is_valid_password` function! Let's put the pieces together.

```python
def is_valid_password(count_min, count_max, letter, password):
    occurrences = password.count(letter)
    return count_min <= occurrences <= count_max
```

Let's test our function against the three test inputs.

```python
>>> lines = ['1-3 a: abcde', '1-3 b: cdefg', '2-9 c: ccccccccc']
>>> tuples = [parse_line(line) for line in lines]
>>> for tup in tuples:
>>>     is_valid = is_valid_password(*tup)
>>>     print(tup, is_valid)
(1, 3, 'a', 'abcde') True
(1, 3, 'b', 'cdefg') False
(2, 9, 'c', 'ccccccccc') True
```

What just happened here? Let me break down a few pieces. First, created a list of the input lines for the
examples. Then, I used a [list
comprehension](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions) to transform each line into a
tuple using the previously created `parse_line` function. Then, I used a `for` loop to iterate through the list of
tuples. The strange `*tup` syntax is what the Python documentation refers to as [unpacking arguments
lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#unpacking-argument-lists). I've heard it referred to most
often as the "splat" operator. It simply takes a tuple (or list or whatever) and uses each element as a different
argument in the function you're calling. So, instead of calling `is_valid_password` with one argument, a tuple, we call
it with four arguments, each element of the tuple. I used it here because I want the `is_valid_password` function to
have reasonable parameter names, but I needed to return a tuple from the `parse_line` function so it could return more
than one value.

Oh, by the way, our code worked! The first and third passwords were valid but the second was invalid (it did not contain
any `b`s but needed at least one).

The last piece is to take a list of passwords and determine how many are valid. For this, we can actually use our
friendly `count` method (and list comprehensions) once again! If we call the `is_valid_password` function on each
password, it will return `True` or `False`. If we then count the number of `True`s in the resulting list, we'll know how
many were valid. Let's try that with our examples and see if it works.

```python
>>> lines = ['1-3 a: abcde', '1-3 b: cdefg', '2-9 c: ccccccccc']
>>> tuples = [parse_line(line) for line in lines]
>>> bools = [is_valid_password(*tup) for tup in tuples]
>>> bools.count(True)
2
```

Looks like it's working. By the way, I don't recommend naming your variables after their data types as a general
practice. I'm using it here to help the reader keep track of data types, especially since Python doesn't have any
explicit data types.

Now it's time to piece everything together! And this time lets use some better variable names.

```python
def num_valid_passwords(input_file):
    lines = get_lines_from_file(input_file)
    password_infos = [parse_line(line) for line in lines]
    password_valids = [is_valid_password(*password_info) for password_info in password_infos]
    return password_valids.count(True)
```

This is a pretty common pattern I follow when writing code. Break pieces into bite-size chunks, then string them
together with descriptive names in between.

And now for the moment of truth:

```python
>>> num_valid_passwords('input.txt')
483
```

If I plug that into [Advent of Code Day 2](adventofcode.com/2020/) it says I'm correct! Remember, however, that everyone
has different inputs, so your answer will be different.
